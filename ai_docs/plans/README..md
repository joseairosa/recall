```

---

## 5. User Flows

### 5.1 Primary Flow

**Step-by-step description of the main use case**

### Example:

```
1. User opens mobile app and authenticates
2. User selects "Start Stock Take" and chooses warehouse location
3. System creates stock-take session, returns session ID
4. User scans product barcode
5. App displays product info and expected quantity
6. User enters actual count
7. If discrepancy > 10%, app prompts for notes
8. User continues scanning products
9. User submits completed stock-take
10. Manager receives notification for review
11. Manager approves/rejects with comments
12. System updates inventory levels if approved
```

### 5.2 Alternative Flows

**What are the edge cases or alternative paths?**

### Example:

```
- Barcode not found: Allow manual SKU entry
- Network offline: Queue updates locally, sync when online
- Partial stock-take: Save progress, resume later
- Bulk update: Upload CSV for large warehouses
```

---

## 6. API Request/Response Examples

### 6.1 Key Endpoint Examples

**Provide actual JSON for the most important endpoints**

```json
// POST /api/v1/stock-takes
Request:
{
  "warehouse_id": "01HGXP3JQWZ8V9N2K1MFAE5R7B",
  "location_zone": "A-1",
  "type": "cycle_count"
}

Response:
{

  }
}
```

---

## 7. Validation Rules & Business Logic

### 7.1 Field Validations
**What validation rules apply?**

### Example:
```
- counted_quantity: Must be >= 0, integer only
- discrepancy_notes: Required if |expected - counted| > 10%
- warehouse_id: Must exist and be active
- barcode: Must match pattern /^[A-Z0-9]{8,13}$/
```

### 7.2 Business Rules
**What business logic needs to be enforced?**

### Example:
```
- Only one active stock-take per warehouse zone at a time
- Stock-takes auto-expire after 24 hours if not submitted
- Discrepancies > 50% require secondary verification
- Cannot modify stock-take after submission
- Manager approval required if total value discrepancy > $1000
```

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Expected Load
**What's the expected usage?**

### Example:
```
- 50 concurrent stock-takes during month-end
- Each stock-take covers ~500 products
- 10 API calls per minute per user during active counting
- Bulk updates of 1000+ items via CSV upload
```

### 8.2 Performance Requirements
**What are the performance targets?**

### Example:
```
- Barcode lookup: < 200ms response time
- Stock-take submission: < 2 seconds for 500 items
- Report generation: < 5 seconds for monthly summary
- Support offline mode with local queue
```

---

## 9. Error Scenarios

### 9.1 Error Cases
**What errors should be handled?**

### Example:
```
1. Product not found by barcode
   - Response: 404 with suggestion to add product first
2. Warehouse at capacity (can't add items)
   - Response: 422 with current capacity info
3. Insufficient permissions
   - Response: 403 with required permission details
4. Network timeout during submission
   - Response: Store locally, retry with idempotency key
```

### 9.2 Recovery Strategies
**How do users recover from errors?**

### Example:
```
- Failed submission: Auto-save draft, retry button
- Partial data loss: Restore from local storage
- Sync conflicts: Show comparison, let user choose
- Invalid barcode: Manual entry fallback
```

## 19. Coding Practices

### 19.1 Database & Migrations
**Database conventions to follow**

### Example:
```
- Always use ULIDs for new tables: text("id").primaryKey() with generateUlid()
- Create new migrations in db/migrate/api with: `bin/rails g migration MigrationName`
- Run ALL migrations with:
  bin/rails db:migrate:primary &&
  bin/rails db:migrate:cable &&
  bin/rails db:migrate:queue &&
  RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate:primary &&
  RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate:cable &&
  RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate:queue
- Follow existing patterns for indexes and foreign keys
- Add appropriate database constraints
```

### 19.2 Caching Implementation
**Caching patterns to follow**

### Example:
```
- Redis configuration follows Rails best practices
- Connection pooling is used to manage Redis connections efficiently
- Error handling ensures the application degrades gracefully if Redis is unavailable
- Defensive programming techniques are applied throughout
- Cache namespace isolation prevents key collisions
- The implementation follows existing caching patterns in the application
- Use Rails.cache for simple key-value caching
- Implement cache warming for frequently accessed data
```

### 19.3 API Design Patterns
**API conventions to follow**

### Example:
```
- Use Kaminari for pagination (see existing implementations)
- Follow RESTful conventions for endpoints
- Use proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 422, etc.)
- Implement idempotency keys for critical operations
- Version APIs when breaking changes are needed
- Use serializers for consistent response formats
- Include proper error messages with error codes
```

### 19.4 Testing Patterns
**Testing conventions to follow**

### Example:
```
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Mock external services in unit tests
- Use factories for test data generation
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios
- Include request specs for all API endpoints
```

### 19.5 Background Jobs
**Job implementation patterns**

### Example:
```
- Use Solid Queue for job processing
- Implement idempotent jobs where possible
- Add proper retry logic with exponential backoff
- Log job execution with correlation IDs
- Monitor job queue depths and processing times
- Handle job failures gracefully
```
